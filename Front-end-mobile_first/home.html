                <p>By the end of this responsive CSS tutorial you will end up with something 
                    similar to the page above. It is a very plain design, but it will do the trick for now.
                    It is fairly easy to clone the image as seen above, but the main goal here is to make it
                    reponsive. To make the website respond based on the size of your device's screen size.       
                </p> 
                <p>Our goal is to create a website which has the basic areas of a website: header, body
                sidebar, and footer. Of course, everything will be responsible, 
                from images down to text and elements placement
